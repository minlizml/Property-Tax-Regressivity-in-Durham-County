# Project Description

This project analyzes property tax assessment disparities across **Durham County, North Carolina**, to support homeowner appeals and advocacy efforts.

Using **R** for data processing, I cleaned and merged multiple property assessment datasets, performed statistical analysis to identify inequities, and developed an interactive **Tableau dashboard** with geographic mapping and filtering capabilities.

The dashboard enables advocacy groups and homeowners to visualize assessment patterns, compare properties across neighborhoods, and access data-driven evidence to support potential tax appeals.

- **Statistical Analysis** – Identify assessment disparities based on property value, location, and type
